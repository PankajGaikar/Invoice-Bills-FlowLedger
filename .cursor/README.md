# Neat Bills Manager — Cursor Kit

**Goal:** Build a delightful, offline-first iOS app that unifies **Invoices** (Accounts Receivable) + **Subscriptions/Bills** (Accounts Payable) with a **Cash-Flow Dashboard** and iPad-optimized UI.

**Non-negotiables**
- No IAPs, no ads.
- Offline-first (SwiftData). Cloud sync (CloudKit) planned for V1.1+.
- iPad UI designed from day one (split views, multi-column, keyboard shortcuts).
- Privacy-first: data stays on device / user’s iCloud when sync ships.

Start with `tasks.md`, then follow `commands.md` for Cursor prompts.
